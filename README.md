# FPGACryptoToolkitSDKX

## Description

A Rust-based cryptocurrency wallet library leveraging zero-knowledge proofs for transaction obfuscation and hardware wallet integration via secure enclave technology.

## Features

- Integrate optimized hardware implementations of AES-GCM with configurable key sizes.
- Implement support for post-quantum cryptography algorithms such as Kyber and Dilithium.
- Provide a high-level API for generating and verifying digital signatures using ECDSA and EdDSA.
- Enable bitstream reconfiguration on-the-fly for algorithm agility without system downtime.
- Incorporate a secure key management module with hardware-based key storage and protection.
- Offer a comprehensive performance profiling tool to analyze FPGA resource utilization and latency.
- Support hardware acceleration for SHA-3 and other cryptographic hash functions with configurable parameters.
- Implement side-channel attack countermeasures including masking and hiding techniques at the hardware level.
